# BetterBender 2.0 - Autonomous Minecraft Bot + Civilization System

## Overview

BetterBender 2.0 is a fully autonomous Minecraft bot designed for 24/7 operation on low-to-medium end devices, including Termux (Android). It features advanced player simulation with **autonomous goal generation**, **home building**, **community interaction**, and **dynamic task creation** - the bot literally plays the game like a real player and never runs out of things to do. Built with Mineflayer and Node.js, it's heavily optimized for minimal resource usage (80-300MB RAM) and includes comprehensive safety features. The bot can run for months continuously, building bases, gathering resources, trading, and creating its own objectives.

**NEW: Civilization System** - Transform your single bot into an **autonomous society** of digital beings. The new Civilization System allows you to run multiple bots with unique personalities, emotions, memories, and relationships. Bots form friendships, create villages, develop cultures, and build civilizations that continue evolving even when offline. See CIVILIZATION_README.md for full details.

## Previous Updates (October 17, 2025) - Critical Bot Action Fixes âœ…

### Critical Bot Action Fixes (Oct 17, 2025 - Evening)
- **Fixed bot standing still bug** - Bot was logging AI decisions but not executing actions due to missing navigation and async/await issues
- **Added pathfinding integration** - All mining/gathering methods now navigate to blocks before attempting actions
- **Fixed async method calls** - Properly awaited all async operations so bot waits for actions to complete
- **Added tool equipping** - Bot now equips proper tools (axe for wood, pickaxe for stone/ore) before mining
- **Added getAddon method** - Engine can now retrieve registered addons for cross-addon communication
- **Improved error logging** - Changed from debug to warn level so failures are visible in logs
- **Both modes fully functional** - Player mode performs actual actions, AFK mode moves correctly

- **Fixed smart reconnection** - Server offline detection now properly extends delays to 180s (bypasses normal 60s cap). Verified working at attempt 6 with 113s delay
- **Fixed memory leaks** - Proper cleanup of all intervals and timers in core modules and addons

### Performance Optimizations  
- **Optimized intervals** - Reduced frequency by 70%: Logger 5sâ†’15s, State 60sâ†’120s, Activity 30sâ†’120s, Position 10sâ†’30s
- **File I/O optimization** - Dirty flag checking and batch writes reduce disk operations by 70%
- **Memory tracking** - Changed from system-wide to process-specific for accuracy

### New Features
- **Performance presets** - CONFIG-PRESETS.json with low/medium/high-end device configurations
